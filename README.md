# Lab03_Word_Guess_Game
C# Console application which allows the user to guess mystery words stored in a text file. The mystery word is selected at random, and the user can try to guess what the word is, one letter at a time. The text file storing the word bank is editable from within the app, so that users can add new words to the word bank, or delete the file to reset the word bank at the start of the next game.
